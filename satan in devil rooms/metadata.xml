    <description>This mod was inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2497020375]Devil Statues Plus[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1190390846]Bombable Devil Statue[/url].

There's a devil statue in each Devil Room. Now, sometimes it'll turn into a Satan fight. Once you defeat Satan, each Devil Deal item will cost a single point of damage rather than one or more heart containers.

Satan has been nerfed a bit here. The Leeches and The Fallen won't show up. The foot stomps will only show up once you reach the Womb.

You can control how often Satan shows up with Mod Config Menu.

If Satan doesn't show up then you can bomb the devil statue to fight the fallen forms of Uriel and Gabriel. They'll drop key pieces like normal.</description>
